"Outside-of-Class" Resources Used:
  1. Used AskBCS when I intitally ran my code and the list of tickers looped through two additional times after the initial run-through. The learning assistant advised that this was from a previous version of my code, and after deleting the unnecessary cells and running my code again the issue was fixed.
  2. Used AskBCS when I was having trouble applying my code to all worksheets. The learning assistant advised that I forgot to include "ws." in front of cells and ranges in my code, and once I did this the code ran smoothly from 2018-2020.
